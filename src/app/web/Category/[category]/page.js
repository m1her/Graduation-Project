    text: "Making and sticking to a budget is a key step towards getting a handle on your debt and working towards a savings goal, of any kind. Let’s say you want to set money aside for emergencies or you aspire to save up for a much larger goal like a car, down payment on a house, or retirement. Until you get a realistic picture of how much money you’re bringing in and where it’s going, it’s difficult to know whether you’ll have enough left over to put away.",

    text: "The former Los Angeles home of David Spade is back on the market for $32.5 million, or about 66% more than what the comic actor sold the property for earlier this year—$19.5 million. Spade, who this year reprised his voice role of the Invisible Man in Hotel Transylvania: Tranformania, listed the property in January 2022 for just under $20 million and had an offer in hand after less than a week on the market, according to the Los Angeles Times. Records show the actor-comedian bought the home in 2001 for roughly $4 million. Located near the Trousdale Estates section of Beverly Hills, the streamlined midcentury modern home is situated on a roomy three-quarter-acre lot that centers on some of the best views in Los Angeles, according to listing agent Stuart Vetterick with Beverly Hills-based brokerage Hilton & Hyland.",
